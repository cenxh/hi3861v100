   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:
   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and
   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and
   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.
   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

## 介绍

欢迎使用Hi3861V100开发OpenHarmony嵌入式应用.



## 硬件说明

这是一个嵌入式软件项目,你需要有一块Hi3861V100的开发板. 
如果你只是想使用这个项目的SDK开发应用,那么基本上任何一块基于Hi3861V100的开发板都是可以的. 
如果你需要运行Vendor目录下的Demo, 目前支持5种类型的开发板:

## 快速上手

可以在Windows环境或"Windows+Linux虚拟机"环境下使用本项目的代码.

### Windows IDE环境搭建

如果在Windows下搭建编译开发环境（目前提供两种编译方式，第一种新建工程，第二种导入工程，任选其一即可实现Hi3861V100编译）, 我们推荐Windows 10 64位系统或以上版本, 简要步骤如下(详细内容参考doc目录下<物联网技术及应用实验指导手册>):
#### 新建工程
1. 下载并安装Windows版本的HUAWEI DevEco Device Tool(devicetool-windows-tool-3.1.0.500.zip)：https://device.harmonyos.com/cn/develop/ide#download

2. 新建工程: 打开已安装DevEco Decive Tool插件的VSCode, 在DevEco Device Tool主页点击"导入工程", 弹窗中选择SDK代码目录, 点击“新建工程”.

3. 后续弹窗"SOC"选择"HI3861", 开发板选择"hi3861", 工程名选择"用户自定义"，工程路径选择”用户自定义“，SDK显示”hi3861_hdu_iot@1.0.0(uninstalled)“,点击"下载".
> **注意：由于windows自身限制，路径不能超过260个字符，在git下载和解压Hi3861 SDK代码时尽量放在磁盘根目录下，防止导致的编译错误问题**
4. 编译: 点击左侧“build”.

5. 烧录: 硬件连接电脑, 如电脑未安装CH340G驱动, 先安装DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0/usb_serial_driver路径下的CH341SER.EXE串口驱动. 然后点击左侧“工程配置”, 找到“upload_port”选项, 选择开发板对应的烧录串口进行烧录. 

6. 按一下复位键, 现在, 你的第一个OpenHarmony程序已经在你的开发板上运行起来了. :thumbsup:
#### 导入工程
   1. 下载并解压Hi3861V100编译工具链：
      https://hispark-obs.obs.cn-east-3.myhuaweicloud.com/DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0.zip

   2. 拉取本项目的SDK代码到本地：

      ```bash
      git clone https://gitee.com/HiSpark/hi3861_hdu_iot_application.git
      ```

      > **注意：由于windows自身限制，路径不能超过260个字符，在git下载和解压Hi3861 SDK代码时尽量放在磁盘根目录下，防止导致的编译错误问题**

   3. 下载并安装Windows版本的HUAWEI DevEco Device Tool(devicetool-windows-tool-3.1.0.500.zip)：https://device.harmonyos.com/cn/develop/ide#download

   4. 导入SDK: 打开已安装DevEco Decive Tool插件的VSCode, 在DevEco Device Tool主页点击"导入工程", 弹窗中选择SDK代码目录, 点击“导入”.

   5. 后续弹窗"SOC"选择"HI3861", 开发板选择"hi3861", 点击"导入".

   6. 配置编译工具链路径: 点击左侧的“工程配置”, 在右侧窗口找到“compiler_bin_path”, 选择到之前下载的开发工具路径, 选择`env_set.py`文件所在的目录层级.

   7. 编译: 点击左侧“build”.

   8. 烧录: 硬件连接电脑, 如电脑未安装CH340G驱动, 先安装DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0/usb_serial_driver路径下的CH341SER.EXE串口驱动. 然后点击左侧“工程配置”, 找到“upload_port”选项, 选择开发板对应的烧录串口进行烧录. 

   9. 按一下复位键, 现在, 你的第一个OpenHarmony程序已经在你的开发板上运行起来了. :thumbsup:

### Windows命令行编译环境搭建

为了方便习惯命令行编译的开发者使用, 我们同时也支持在Windows命令行环境编译方式:
前两步操作与IDE环境搭建方式相同, 即下载并解压Hi3861V100编译工具链和拉取SDK代码到本地. 然后:
1. 进入DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0.zip解压后目录, 双击运行`env_start.bat`, 则将在完成首次配置后, 进入一个转为编译Hi3861V100而配置的命令行环境;
2. 在命令行窗口中切换到SDK所在的src目录:
    ```
    [DevTools] D:\DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0>cd d:\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src
    ```
3. 执行命令 `hb set`, 直接回车选择当前缺省选项, 执行命令`hb build`:
    ```
    [DevTools] D:\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src>hb set
    [DevTools] D:\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src>hb build
    ```
    即完成编译. 
    
    > **如有提示`account_related_group_manager_mock.c: No such file or directory`之类报错信息, 是Windows系统文件路径不能超过260字符的限制所致, 请尝试将SDK代码仓放置于较浅层的磁盘目录下重新尝试**
4. 编译后镜像文件位于 out/hispark_pegasus/wifiiot_hispark_pegasus/Hi3861_wifiiot_app_allinone.bin, 使用DevTools_Hi3861V100_v1.0/burntool/BurnTool.exe完成烧录. (如果缺少USB转串口驱动, 则执行usb_serial_driver\CH341SER.EXE安装)

### Linux环境搭建

如果在Linux下搭建编译开发环境, 我们推荐的虚拟机系统配置为VirtualBox 6.0 + Ubuntu20.04, 推荐虚拟机内存2G以上, 虚拟机硬盘20G以上. 你可以通过搜索学习相关的网络文章实现安装虚拟机Linux.

我们推荐使用两块虚拟机网卡, 一块设置成NAT方式, 用于虚拟机连接外部网络, 一块使用Host Only模式, 用于宿主机连接虚拟机, 这样你会遇到最少的问题.

装好虚拟机Linux后, 你可以参考doc目录下的教程手动安装所需的Linux软件, 搭建所有的软件编译环境. 如果你觉得自己从头搭建环境对你来说太复杂, 或者担心新装软件会与原本系统里的一些软件冲突, 又或者你只是想小试一下OpenHarmony的开发体验, 或者你单纯就是懒的话!😶, 我们推荐你使用我们已经封装好的Docker, 因为它是如此的方便! 你只要按照以下的指导一步一步输入命令就可以:

1. 安装docker(如果你的Ubuntu系统没有docker的话)

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io -y
   ```

   或者

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker --mirror Aliyun
   ```

2. 拉取我们封装好的Docker镜像到本地

   ```bash
   docker pull hispark/hi3861_hdu_iot_application:1.0
   ```

3. 新建一个容器命名为openharmony, 映射你的用户目录~到容器内目录/home/hispark, 同时把容器端口22映射为外部端口2222

   ```bash
   docker run -itd -p 2222:22 -v ~/code:/home/hispark --name openharmony hispark/hi3861_hdu_iot_application:1.0
   ```

4. 进入容器

   ```bash
   docker exec -it openharmony /bin/bash
   ```
   >  现在你已经有了一个专门用来编译代码的Docker容器环境了. 你每次可以在虚拟机linux中执行命令行`docker exec -it openharmony /bin/bash`进入这个Docker容器环境, 也可以在Windows中通过ssh软件(推荐MobaXTerm)连接虚拟机的2222端口进入(账户名root, 密码123456)

5. 进入目录拉取代码
    通过命令行或ssh进入容器内部环境中, 执行
    ```
    cd /home/hispark
    git clone https://gitee.com/HiSpark/hi3861_hdu_iot_application.git
    ```
    > **我们建议你把所有代码工作都保存在/home/hispark这个映射目录中, 这是因为Docker的容器环境是临时性的, 当Docker容器销毁时, 内部所有数据信息都会被删除而且无法恢复, 这就是为什么我们强烈建议你把代码工作保存在映射的用户目录中, 因为这里是你真实的用户存储空间, 不会随Docker容器销毁而消失.**

6. 编译: 进入src目录, 执行命令`hb set`, 回车两次, 配置OpenHarmony信息
    ```bash
    cd hi3861_hdu_iot_application/src
    hb set
    hb build -f
    ```

    > 编译完成后的固件镜像在src/out目录中. 编译后的镜像名为Hi3861_loader_signed.bin和Hi3861_wifiiot_app_burn.bin

7. 烧录: 编译后的镜像文件copy到Windows中(通过samba或ssh), 然后运行HiBurn([下载](https://ost.51cto.com/resource/29)), 将镜像下载到板上运行. 这里我还是推荐你用命令行的方式运行: 在Windows中建立这样一个脚本, 并命名为例如fast_burn.bat之类的名字, 复制以下内容, 并将大括号{}部分替换为你的实际信息, 修改并保存.

    ```bat
    @ fast_burn.bat
    copy
    \\{samba路径}\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src\out\hispark_pegasus\wifiiot_hispark_
    pegasus\Hi3861_loader_signed.bin .
    copy
    \\{samba路径}\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src\out\hispark_pegasus\wifiiot_hispark_
    pegasus\Hi3861_wifiiot_app_burn.bin .
    {HiBurn路径} -com:{串口端口号} -bin:Hi3861_wifiiot_app_burn.bin -signalbaud:2000000 -2ms -
    loader:Hi3861_loader_signed.bin
    ```
    
    比如, 我这里的虚拟机网卡IP是192.168.101.56, 我在Win10中通过samba去访问我的代码路径是\\192.168.101.56\share\code, hiburn存放在我电脑的d:\hispark\util目录下, 开发板接入我的电脑, 设备管理器里查看串口号为4, 所以我这里的fast_burn.bat是这样的

    ```bat
    @ fast_burn.bat
    copy
    \\192.168.101.56\share\code\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src\out\hispark_pegasus\wifiiot_hispark_
    pegasus\Hi3861_loader_signed.bin .
    copy
    \\192.168.101.56\share\code\hi3861_hdu_iot_application\src\out\hispark_pegasus\wifiiot_hispark_
    pegasus\Hi3861_wifiiot_app_burn.bin .
    d:\hispark\util\hiburn.exe -com:4 -bin:Hi3861_wifiiot_app_burn.bin -signalbaud:2000000 -2ms -
    loader:Hi3861_loader_signed.bin
    ```
    假设上述一切顺利的话, 现在双击这个fast_burn.bat, 将会跳出一个命令行窗口, 并提示你按一下板子的复位按键. 按开发板的复位键后将会自动进入固件烧录过程, 烧录完毕后窗口会自动关闭.

1. 再按一下复位键, 现在, 你的第一个OpenHarmony程序已经在你的开发板上运行起来了. :thumbsup:
